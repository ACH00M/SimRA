# SimRA
SimRA is a framework for simulating generic and complex evolu- tionary scenarios of multiple populations with subdivision and admixture. The algorithm generates a network structure, called Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG), that models coalescence and genetic exchange events (recombinations) with SNP as well as STR polymorphisms.
