# SimRA
SimRA is a framework for simulating generic and complex evolutionary scenarios of multiple populations with subdivision and admixture. The algorithm generates a network structure, called Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG), that models coalescence and genetic exchange events (recombinations) with SNP as well as STR polymorphisms.

SimRA has been developed in java under the Eclipse Framework

#Pre-requisites

- Java JDK (version 1.6)
- Apache Commons Math library. The jar file commons-math3-3.5.jar must be downloaded and stored in the SimRA lib folder. You can dowload it from http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/download_math.cgi.
- Eclipse (Recommended, not required)

#Get Started

git clone git://github.com/ComputationalGenomics/SimRA

or you may want directly import the project on Eclipse (please see this wiki: https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway/wiki/Importing-source-code-into-Eclipse)
