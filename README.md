# SimRA
SimRA is a framework for simulating generic and complex evolutionary scenarios of multiple populations with subdivision and admixture. The algorithm generates a network structure, called Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG), that models coalescence and genetic exchange events (recombinations) with SNP as well as STR polymorphisms.

#Pre-requisites

- Java JDK (version 1.6)
- Apache Commons Math library. The jar file commons-math3-3.5.jar must be downloaded and stored in the directory SimRA lib. You can dowload it from http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/download_math.cgi.
- Eclipse (Recommended, not required)

#Get Started

git clone git://github.com/ComputationalGenomics/SimRA
